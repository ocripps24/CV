## Background

I love discovering how things work and then learning how to make them myself. My passion for tech began with a Christmas card made in Microsoft Paint back in 1995, followed by a GTA cheatcode website a year later. Since then I've been developing my creativity and professional skillset across medical and financial disciplines.

Working in Investor Relations gave me solid grounding in several key professional areas, managing high-stakes projects with C-suite level stakeholders and working efficiently under pressure. I also had the opportunity to manage several creative and technical projects further feeding my love for and interest in working in tech.

I'm excited to join a company delivering innovative projects with intelligent design where I can express my creativity and attention to detail as well as continuing my personal learning journey.

## Skills

#### Analytical thinking

Through medical school and now working with code, I have built strong analytical frameworks to diagnose issues methodically and construct a pathway to solve and move beyond issues/errors. Particularly as a result of using TDD, I have grown to enjoy debugging. It is an important part of my learning process and I enjoy applying my cross-disciplinary skills to aid this process.

- Most recently I fixed our first group <a href="https://github.com/ocripps24/MakersBnb">project</a> that had broken and whose instructions had gone missing.
- I started by reviewing the documentation for the frameworks to rebuild the instruction base and continued by debugging each of the broken tests until they passed. I finished by connecting the project to Travis.

#### Creativity

I take great satisfaction from building things with creative and intelligent design. My creativity stems from a desire and perseverance to understand how something works and the challenge of learning new skills in the pursuit of creation. This is particularly true with graphic design software.

- After driving an increase in design projects at my previous employer, I had to adapt and teach myself how to use several of the Adobe Creative Cloud apps to meet demand, facilitate faster project turnaround and often make live changes or suggestions during client meetings.
- When faced with a recent client <a href="http://www.udugufs.com/">website</a> project without the resources for a designer, I applied my skills to create the entire website design from scratch ensuring that it adhered to their brand guidelines and tone of audience.
- Created booklets for company thinktank events, client presentations, branding elements as well as extending the work of other designers in various capacities.

#### Self-directed Learner

I have always had a passion for learning and been able to dictate my own self-driven learning plans and goals. My time at Makers has enabled me to expand upon these skills while considering new concepts like 'Mastery'. During my time at Makers, I had to use these skills alongside a growth mindset to stay on top of the course materials.

- Able to break higher learning goals into researchable chunks and identify helpful documentation. I also choose to keep a learning log and reflect on my progress when taking on substantial learning objectives.
- Completed 100+ hours of studying to attain a Certificate in UK Corporate Investor Relations from the IR Society.
- Consistently engage with Massive Open Online Courses covering a variety of personal interests.
